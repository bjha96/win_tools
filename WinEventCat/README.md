# WinEventCat
A simple command line tool for reading and extracting Windows events, written in C#.
Run the CLI without any cmd line args to get the usage options.

The goal of this project is to create a simple utility without using 3rd party libraries.
It uses standard APIs and libraries available on the vanilla windows .Net runtime.
